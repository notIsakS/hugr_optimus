# Components - Composition & Zero-Copy Architecture
Running multiple nodes from a single executable via a Component Container. Reduces power and memory overhead with large node counts.

Intra-Process Communication (IPC): Bypasses the DDS middleware stack for co-located nodes. Messages pass via shared pointers (zero-copy) instead of serializing, deserializing, and copying data across network or process boundaries.

Inter-Process Zero-Copy (DDS / Shared Memory): When nodes run in separate processes on the same machine, zero-copy is still achievable via specific RMW implementations (e.g., Fast DDS with Loaned Messages or Eclipse Iceoryx) using shared memory segments instead of network sockets.

## When to Use vs. When NOT to Use
### Use Composition & Zero-Copy When:
Resource-Constrained Embedded Systems: Maximizing CPU efficiency and memory bandwidth on edge hardware.

High-Frequency Sensor Streams: Processing heavy data (LiDAR, high-res cameras, IMUs) where serialization bottlenecks throughput and increases latency.

Production Deployment: Bridging the gap from modular prototyping to deterministic, industrial-grade performance.

C++ Environments: Leveraging native shared-library plugin architectures (rclcpp_components).

### Do NOT Use Composition & Zero-Copy When:
Fault Isolation is Critical: If a segmentation fault or crash in one node brings down the entire container process. Standalone processes isolate failures.

Debugging and Profiling: Single-process debugging with multithreading is significantly harder (race conditions, deadlocks) than isolating individual nodes.

Language Agnosticism Required: Mixing Python nodes into the same in-process zero-copy pipeline (Python components cannot use intra-process zero-copy shared pointers).

Distributed Multi-Machine Architectures: Nodes that inherently need to run on separate physical hardware units (DDS network transport is mandatory here).

Buffer error, exceeding limits may not be caused my using DDS instead of IPC, but may be of wromng QoS setup. Where single threaeded callbacks may take too lon.
