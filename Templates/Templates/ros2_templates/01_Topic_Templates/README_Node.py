    main()                                # Executes the main function when the script is run directly.

# In the terminal after running it you would get a: [info][timestamp][node_name] corresponding to line 13 and 14
# Important after making a node add it to the "Entry points" in the setup.py
# Remember that colcon build will place the executables in install folder
# Easy to get confused because the node is defined on line 13, but it does not need to have the same name as the package, and also in setup.py the node_name can be called something else. Good place to troubleshoot.
