# We start with getting request from Goal
# We must have the client create, then send the goal to the server
# Use send_goal_asyc as normal may give problem with rclspin

# With terminals we  see:

# Terminal 1: Action server has been started
# Terminal 2: Sending Goal
# Terminal 1: Execution the goal ... | Terminal 2: Goal Was accepted/rejected -> accepted would continoue with feedback


# We use callbaskcs and future 's

# One of the strong points of actins Accept or Reject a goal
# we must validate the request (that the msg/srv data type is allowed) like if only ints, -1 is illegal. Can set ACCEPT or REJECT
